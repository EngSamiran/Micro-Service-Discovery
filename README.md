Eureka Server: Acts as the registry where all the microservices register themselves, making them discoverable by other services in the ecosystem.

Eureka Clients: Microservices that register with the Eureka server and query it to discover other services. They can also periodically send heartbeats to maintain their presence.

Self-healing and Resilience: Eureka clients regularly check with the Eureka server for updates on the available services and re-route requests in case a service becomes unavailable.
